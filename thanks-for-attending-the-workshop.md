Hello!

Thank you for attending the workshop, and thank you to Cora, Monika, Flora, and Fatime from Geek Girls Carrots for being such great helpers!

I had a great time running the workshop thanks to such a great audience, you gave me the inspiration and motivation to run further workshops :)

If you haven't filled it out already, I'd love your feedback on the workshop and suggestions for improvement in this brief survey: <http://bit.ly/eystein-feedback>

**Resources used in the workshop:**
* The slides are available in the ‚Äúslides-markdown‚Äù folder at:

You can view each slide by clicking on them in the [slides-markdown](https://github.com/eystein/intro-HTML-CSS-workshop/tree/master/slides-markdown) folder.
* I‚Äôve also included an list with suggested reading for blogs, tools, newsletters, further courses, CSS grid, podcasts, and interesting people on Twitter. I suspect this list could grow indefinitely - I might turn it into a newsletter if anyone is interested!
* The **CSS Grid** slides where from a separate presentation, which you can view on <https://www.slideshare.net/eystein/css-grid-114981406>. The specific slides I covered during the workshop was from slide 71 to 84.
