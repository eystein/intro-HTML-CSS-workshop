# Add meaning to text using `em` and `strong`

```html
<p>
Here is a paragraph with <em>emphasised</em> text and <strong>important</strong> text.
</p>
```

Here is a paragraph with _emphasised_ text and **important** text.

## Note
`em` and `strong` are meant to indicate meaning through style.

If you want to have italicised for appearance and not to communicate meaning, you should use CSS.

```css
p.intro {
  font-style: italic;
}
```
