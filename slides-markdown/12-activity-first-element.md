# Create our first HTML element

```html
<p>I am a paragraph element.</p>
```

* Create a new CodePen file.
* Only use `<p>`'s.
* Try to reformat the whitespace in the HTML. Does it makes any difference?

CodePen example: [#activity 03:  Create our first HTML elements - <p>](https://codepen.io/eystein/pen/vYYELBW?editors=1000)

```html
<p>
  One line of text that goes
  over two or more lines in the
  HTML, but how does it look
  in the browser?
</p>
<p>And what about a couple short lines?</p><p>What's going on here?</p>


<p>How about if I make a lot of space in between?</p>
```
