# ID's and Classes

## ID тЪая╕П
Should only apply to one element on a webpage. For example a webpage only has one footer.

The `#` Hash symbol is how you tell CSS "this is an `id`"".

## Class ЁЯЪА
Lots of elements can have the same class. There can be many warnings on one webpage.

The `.` period is how you tell CSS "this is a `class` name."

## Examples

### HTML

```html
<img id="main-banner" src="..." alt="..." />

<p class="warning">Danger danger!</p>
```

### CSS

```css
#id {
  width: 100%;
}

.warning {
  background-color: red;
  color: white;
}
```
